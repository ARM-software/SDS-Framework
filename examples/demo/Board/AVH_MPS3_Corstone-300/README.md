Board: ARM AVH_MPS3_Corstone-300
----------------------------------------------

MPS3 platform for Corstone-300 simulated by Arm Virtual Hardware Targets (VHT).

The following models are available:
 - VHT_MPS3_Corstone_SSE-300: Corstone-300 for MPS3
 - VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U55: Corstone-300 with Ethos-U55 for MPS3
 - VHT_Corstone_SSE-300_Ethos-U65: Corstone-300 with Ethos-U55 for MPS3

Running the VHT in uVision requires the following settings:
 - open "Options for Target"
 - select "Debug" tab
 - under "Use" select "Models ARMv8-M Debugger" and click "Settings" end enter the following:
   - Command: `$KARM\VHT\VHT_MPS3_Corstone_SSE-300.exe`
   - Target: `cpu0`
   - Configuration File: `Board\AVH_MPS3_Corstone-300\fvp_config.txt`

Running the VHT via command line (from project root directory and VHT executable in path):
`VHT_MPS3_Corstone_SSE-300 -f Board/AVH_MPS3_Corstone-300/fvp_config.txt -a <image>`

> Note: running on fast computers can lead to simulation running too quickly resulting in dropping incoming data packets from the network. 
  This will be seen as error messages in the terminal window.  
  Reduce the number of ticks to simulate for each quantum by specifying the following command line option `-Q <n>`, 
  where `<n>` is the number of ticks (default value = 10000).  
  Example: `-Q 10`
