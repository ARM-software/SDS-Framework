/**
\fn          sdsRecPlayId_t sdsRecOpen (const char *name, void *buf, uint32_t buf_size)
\details
Opens a recorder stream for writing timestamps and data blocks to the SDS file. The `buf` parameter specifies
a user-allocated memory region that serves as an internal circular buffer. The buffer must be large enough
to hold at least the largest expected data block plus 8 bytes for the record header.

The `name` parameter defines the base name for the SDS output file and is used to construct the full file name in the
format `name.index.sds`. The `index` is an auto-incrementing value that ensures a unique file name is generated.
If a file with the generated name already exists, the `index` is incremented until an unused name is found.
For details on the file naming convention, refer to the *SDS Data Files: Filenames* section in the *Theory of Operation* chapter.

This function returns a handle that uniquely identifies the stream. The handle is used as a reference in
subsequent function calls to perform operations on the stream.
*/

/**

\details
Closes a recorder stream. Prior to closing, any remaining data in the internal circular buffer is flushed to the SDS file.

becomes invalid.
*/

/**
\fn          int32_t sdsRecWrite (sdsRecPlayId_t id, uint32_t timestamp, const void *buf, uint32_t buf_size)
\details
Writes a data block, including a header containing the timestamp and data block size, to the internal circular buffer.
The `sdsRecPlayThread` worker thread asynchronously processes the buffer, writing the data to the SDS file via the underlying SDS I/O interface.
This asynchronous design enables efficient, non-blocking data handling and optimized performance.

Before writing, the function verifies that the data block fits within the available space in the internal buffer.
If insufficient space is available, the operation is aborted and the function returns \ref SDS_REC_ERROR_NO_SPACE.

On success, the function writes the header and data block to the stream buffer and returns the number of data bytes written,
excluding the header.

Thread safety is ensured by allowing only a single thread to write to a given stream at a time.
However, multiple threads can concurrently write to different streams, enabling parallel operations across multiple streams.
*/

/**
\fn          sdsRecPlayId_t sdsPlayOpen (const char *name, void *buf, uint32_t buf_size)

Opens a player stream for reading timestamps and data blocks from an SDS file. The `buf` parameter specifies a user-allocated
memory region used as an internal circular buffer. The buffer must be large enough to accommodate the largest expected data block
plus 8 bytes for the record header.

The `name` parameter specifies the base name of the SDS input file. The function attempts to locate and open the file
`<name>.<index>.sds`, where `<index>` is an auto-incrementing value. If no matching file is found, the function returns an error.
For details on the file naming convention, refer to the *SDS Data Files: Filenames* section in the *Theory of Operation* chapter.

This function may block for a period of time while it loads the internal circular buffer with data from the SDS file.

This function returns a handle that uniquely identifies the stream. The handle is used as a reference in subsequent
function calls to perform operations on the stream.

/**

Closes a player stream. The function waits for all pending data transfers to complete or until a timeout occurs.

*/

/**
\fn          int32_t sdsPlayRead (sdsRecPlayId_t id, uint32_t *timestamp, void *buf, uint32_t buf_size)
\details
Reads a data block along with its associated timestamp from the internal circular buffer. The `sdsRecPlayThread` worker thread asynchronously
reads the data from the SDS file using the underlying SDS I/O interface and writes it to the internal circular buffer.
This asynchronous design enables efficient, non-blocking data handling and ensures optimal performance.

Before attempting to read, this function verifies that both the header and its associated data are present and fully valid within the SDS Stream buffer.
If either the header or data is missing or incomplete, the function aborts and returns \ref SDS_PLAY_ERROR_NO_DATA. The function confirms that the provided buffer
can accommodate the entire data block. If the provided buffer is too small, it aborts and returns \ref SDS_REC_PLAY_ERROR_PARAMETER.
If the end of the stream has been reached, the function returns \ref SDS_PLAY_EOS.

On success, the function reads the data block from the stream buffer, stores it in the user-provided buffer, and returns
the the size of the data block in bytes. The associated timestamp is returned via the output parameter `timestamp`.

Thread safety is ensured by allowing only a single thread to read from a given stream at a time.
However, multiple threads can concurrently read from different streams, enabling parallel operations across multiple streams.
