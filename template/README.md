# SDS Template Application

The SDS template application is a test framework for DSP and ML algorithms. It allows recording and playback of real-world data streams using physical hardware or on simulation models using (Arm Virtual Hardware - FVP) to an user algorithm under test. The real-world data streams are captured in SDS data files.
