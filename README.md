# SDS Framework

The **Synchronous Data Stream (SDS) Framework** implements a data stream management, provides methods and helper tools for developing and optimizing embedded applications that integrate DSP and ML algorithms. This framework relates to the [**Compute Graph streaming**](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP/tree/main/ComputeGraph) that is part of the CMSIS-DSP compute library.

## Overview 

- Implements a flexible data stream management for sensor and audio data interfaces
   - Supports data streams from multiple interfaces including provisions for time drifts. 

- Provides methods to **record real-world data** for analysis and development
  - Input to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) development tools such as filter designers
  - Input to Machine Learning (ML) model classification, training, and performance optimization
  - Verify execution of DSP algorithm on Cortex-M targets with off-line tools

- **Playback real-world data** for algorithm validation using Arm Virtual Hardware
  - Input to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) development tools such as filter designers
  - Input to Machine Learning (ML) model classification, training, and performance optimization 
  - Verify execution of DSP algorithm on Cortex-M targets with off-line tools

- Defines binary data format with [YAML metadata file](./schema/README.md).

- [Python-based utilities](./utilities/README.md) for recording, playback, visualization, and data conversion

## Interfaces

The [SDS Framework interfaces](./sds/README.md) implement the SDS streaming interfaces via different methods. The functions of the **sds.h Circular Buffer Handling** may be used at any level of a Compute Graph to provide inputs or capture outputs of an DSP or ML algorithm.

The [Sensor interfaces](./sensor/README.md) provide the software layer for the connection to the physical sensors.
